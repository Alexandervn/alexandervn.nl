Advantages over other editors or IDE's:

* Fast keyboard shortcuts&mdash;don't use your mouse or arrow keys
* Syntax coloring for even the most obscure languages
* Syntax checking through external commands like jshint or csslint (or integrated with Syntastic)
* Your complete configuration in file format (.vimrc) which makes it easy to version and distribute (on [Github](https://github.com/Alexandervn/dotfiles "Github"))
* Very lightweight (compared to IDE's like Aptana or NetBeans)
* Works over SSH on remote servers
* Cross-platform and installed by default on OS X and Linux
* Programmable with VimScript and other scripting languages
* Thousands of plugins available; for adding functionality like snippets, file browsers or (D)VCS integration

Personally, I use Vim for much more than only programming now. Be it notes, todo lists, documentation or long mails: Vim is what I use now. Why do you need Evernote, if you have Vim and Dropbox?

This is what the Pragmatic Programmer prescribes:

> Use a single editor well: the editor should be an extension of your hand; make sure your editor is configurable, extensible and programmable.
